        "Tomato (Round) SZL/1kg": (
            "Tomato prices are highly seasonal, influenced by rainfall and pest outbreaks. "
            "Models like SARIMA capture seasonality better here, while machine learning models "
            "may overfit. Farmers can benefit from knowing short-term volatility to plan harvest cycles."
        ),
        "Cabbage SZL/Head": (
            "Cabbage prices are relatively stable but respond sharply to transportation costs. "
            "Inflation and fuel prices affect its retail value. ARIMA-based models often perform "
            "well because trends are smoother compared to tomatoes."
        ),
        "Maize SZL/50kg": (
            "Maize is a staple crop and its price dynamics strongly depend on the Crop Production Index "
            "and rainfall variability. Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) handles long-term dependencies "
            "effectively, making it suitable for maize forecasting."
        ),
        "Potatoes SZL/50kg": (
            "Potato prices fluctuate with storage availability and post-harvest losses. "
            "Short-term shocks are better captured by XGBoost due to its ability to learn from multiple signals. "
            "However, volatility remains moderate compared to tomatoes."
        ),
        "Sugar SZL/1kg": (
            "Sugar pricing is linked to both domestic production and international market fluctuations. "
            "Global commodity trends play a significant role, making SARIMA and ARIMA reliable choices."
        ),
        "Beans SZL/1kg": (
            "Bean prices are sensitive to seasonal production and household demand. "
            "Rural market shocks influence beans significantly. LSTM models have shown good performance "
            "in capturing cyclical demand shifts."
        ),
        "Onion SZL/1kg": (
            "Onion prices often experience sharp peaks due to storage limitations. "
            "Machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost handle non-linear fluctuations well, "
            "though traditional SARIMA can capture seasonal cycles effectively."
        ),
        "Diesel SZL/1 liter": (
            "Diesel prices are policy-driven and influenced by international crude oil trends. "
            "Forecasting is less about agriculture and more about global economics. SARIMA and ARIMA remain "
            "effective as they capture macroeconomic shocks better than ML-based models."
        ),
        "Gas SZL/1 liter": (
            "Gas prices are linked to energy policy and import costs. Random fluctuations are smoother, "
            "and thus ARIMA generally suffices, though XGBoost can help when incorporating additional covariates."
        ),
        "Inflation rate": (
            "Inflation influences every variable in the system. Long short-term memory (LSTM) models "
            "are effective at capturing the macroeconomic cycles that inflation follows."
        ),
        "Crop Production Index": (
            "The crop production index reflects aggregate agricultural output. "
            "It is less volatile and trends are best captured by ARIMA models. "
            "It also serves as a key input for crop-specific forecasts."
